Welcome to the README section of Vehicle Test Data Analytics Platform, this project is a demo showcasing data driven insights of vehicle. Most of the explanation and logic given in the code already, so please feel free to go through. 
Do follow the points while looking at the repository 

I. There numbering order given in which order the code can be executed, however for the 2nd part, consider vehicle_logs file
II. Whenever executed, the data is overwritten as this meant to be on spot data generation and working with any other previous dataset 
III. Lastly go through as I am open to feedback 

Thank you!
